  # NHO: How could you DRY up this code? I see an opportunity for something along the lines of before_action :find_book_review
  # NHO: In general, Rails style guides advise Fat Models, Skinny Controllers.
  # NHO: I would advise to simplify controller code by moving our main business logic to our models
  # NHO: would recommend creating custom models or methods on existing models to help simplify
