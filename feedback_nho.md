# Feedback

## Project Workflow

**Exceeds Expectations**

Excellent comments in the Readme and user stories! In the future, please include
set up instructions for your application. This will be useful to future you and potential technical
employers / interviewers who are not familiar with rails. I would also recommend switching to markdown (.md) extensions for your readme, and other text documents to take advantage of the formatting.

## Technical Requirements

**Exceeds Expectations**

Great job going beyond the minimum requirements! Nice use of external apis to pull data, and liked your approach with your models, and associations. I think you've already identified opportunities to work on the relationships in the future. Also if interested, I recommend adding in a social feature like following for users to track other users reviews, favorite, or messaging. This will allow you to practice many-to-many associations and creating
join tables.

## Creativity / Interface

**Meets Expectations**

Nice to see you make this project your own. I would love to see you continue to work on this, as we start learning about things such as bootstrap, grids, and SASS. It might also be worth checking in with one of the
UX designers. They just finished code week - you could trade help with them!

## Code Quality

## Deployment and Functionality

**Meets Expectations**

Great job hitting your MVP, app is functional, and deployed! Would like to see you come back to this and keep expanding on this project. Hope you get to implement CanCanCan to help lock down user authentication!
